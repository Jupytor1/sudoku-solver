# sudoku-solver

Hello, I'm Jupytor.

I'm an 18-year-old Japanese student.
I love coding and solving sudoku (sudoku is a popular puzzle played in everywhere).
A few days ago, I came up with an idea to create a sudoku solver, and I made it.

This program will solve any sudoku problem which has only one answer.

It requires a uniform input format like this:
......26.
.1..5....
..3..6...
..5.9.4..
...2.4..7
38.......
75....9..
......1.8
6...85.3.
    
'.' means the square is blank.

The program will print the answer in less than 1 second.

I'm not sure whether "puzzle-solving-program" like this is useful, but if you are interested, feel free to copy the source code.
